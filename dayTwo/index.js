// Forking essentially is taking over people code and using it for ourselves

// Your Task is to go onto github and find a repo 
// that you like the idea of -- It can be anything
// Fork it and then, then clone it and then add 
// a commit to this forked repo -- just a txt file
// as to why you like the repo

// Go onto QA Community On both the forking and 
// merging pages and then continue to do the tutorials.
