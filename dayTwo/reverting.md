So within git -- we are able to reverse time -- rebasing 

reverting -- git revert we are able to essential go back in time 
git revert will create a new commit -- undoing what we have previously done

-- 2 steps forward - 1 step backwards
-- Revert -- soft reset -- you're not literally destroying your history
-- Merge conflicts start to get out of hand -- Reverting is good
