Within your teams I require you all to get into your groups:


I want one person to make a repo and then that person must give 
contribution access to the other members in their team

After this ensure you have a dev branch -- and on this each member should make 
a feature branch f-<Name> 

Once this is all complete Merge the feature into dev and then --- Make a pull Request
to accept dev into main

Once done show me your network graph and I shall access whether or not you followed the FBM
